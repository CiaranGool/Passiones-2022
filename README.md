<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To edit the files, you need to have GameMaker Studio 2 installed for the optimal experience. GameMaker Studio 2 has it's own language. If you just want to experience my game, you can simple run the executable after downloading the .zip file. If you want to make changes to the code, all the code can be found inside the objects. The tilesets can be found in the Tile Set file, and should NOT be deleted if you want to make changes to the game room, all objects will be removed. You can edit all the sprites in the Sprite file and change the animation or design of the sprites. You can change the level design by editing the game room. Lastly you can change the script files, if you want to make mayor changes to the game.
